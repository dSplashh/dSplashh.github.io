        <h1>Welcome To My Final Project Page</h1>
        <p> This is my final project in my portfolio. My partner and I was really going for something real calm but at the same time really interesting. <br>
           What this code produces is a ship shifting game game where whoever is playing has five lives and the objective is to keep the ship intact. The game also tracks  <br>
            your score and if, as a user, the score of 10,000 is reached then you have beat the game and your a legend. The game is played with two buttons, left arrow and right arrow. <br>
            The two buttons are used to shift left (technically up) and right (technically down)  <br>
            Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend in this game.
