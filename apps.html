        <h1>Welcome To My Final Project Page</h1>
        <p> This is my final project in my portfolio. My partner and I was really going for something simple but at the same time really interesting. <br>
           What this code produces is a rock, paper, and scissors game where whoever is playing is playing against the computer. When playing the game, what  <br>
            is needed to know is that, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. After the "let's play!" button is pressed, the game screen will appear <br>
            with three buttons which is three options or choices the user can make, which are rock, paper, or scissors. Every time the user beats the computer, playerscore <br>
            goes up by one point. Every time the computer beats the user, computerscore goes up by one point.
