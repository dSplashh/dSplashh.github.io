        <p> My name is Darryl A. Fleurantin. This website is my portfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island for the fall. <br>
            2020 term. I wrote this webpage itself using HTML programming language. Over this course I have been learning different aspects of programing <br> and also different skills that I have been equipped with for my future in my major. In my javascripts section, are filled <br>
            with screenshots of all the programs that I was assigned to construct along with the link to all my codes when clicked on. </p>
