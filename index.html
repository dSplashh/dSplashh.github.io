        <h1>Welcome To My Page</h1>
        <p> My name is Darryl A. Fleurantin. This website is my portfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
            I wrote this webpage itself using HTML programming language. The Apps link above has apps I have written that run on phones. The Javascripts link above has Javascripts that <br>
            I have written to be embedded in web pages. </p>
